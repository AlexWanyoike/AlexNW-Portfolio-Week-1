                        <p>This project below aimed to know the difference between two Kenyan number plates. Upon inputing two variables one would be able to tally the number of units sold. The programming language was R that I was trying to put in place.</p>

                        <p>The project aimed to make my first website without the aid of the Moringa School Canva LMS course work. The project was both a success and a failure at the same time. The language used is HTML.</p>

                        <p>From this project, we aimed to understand cloning, forking, pushing, and pulling from Git to GitHub. I was able to follow along with the necessary steps to make a successful website. The language used is HTML.</p>

        <h3>The Why?!</h3>
        <img src="Image/Simple Work LinkedIn Banner (2).png" alt="The Why?">
            <p>Why did I decide to join Moringa School and why programming? I was very fortunate enough to have worked at Tata Consultancy Services in Mumbai, India, and the level of technology its impact on its users inspired. The scale at which their programs made people’s lives easier made me yearn to be part of the community and that’s where Moringa School came in. I clearly know I wanted the skill rather than the nitty gitties of programming. Researching and talking to a fellow Moringa school alumnus they recommended that this was the place to be. The far this work with Moringa School has been amazing, I hope at the end of this journey all shall remain well.</p>
