   <h2>The past week has given me an opportunity to work on projects. Many have failed but I believe life is all about failing forward. Kindly find the list below:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Number-plate-Difference</li>
                <p>This project below aimed to know the difference between two Kenyan number plates. Upon inputing two variables one would be able to tally the number of units sold. The programming language was R that I was trying to put in place.</p>
            <li>First-website-10-01</li>
                <p>The project aimed to make my first website without the aid of the Moringa School Canva LMS course work. The project was both a success and a failure at the same time. The language used is HTML.</p>
            <li>Cookie-recipe</li>
                <p>From this project, we aimed to understand cloning, forking, pushing, and pulling from Git to GitHub. I was able to follow along with the necessary steps to make a successful website. The language used is HTML.</p>
